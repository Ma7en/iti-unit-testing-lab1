// Lab1 - Testing



Lab 1
1- True or False:

Why is Testing necessary?
    1- because software is likely to have faults
    [True]

    2- To learn about the reliability of the software
    [True]
    
    3- To fill the time between the delivery of the software and the release date
    [False]
    
    4- To prove that the software has no faults
    [False]
    
    5- Because testing is included in the project plan
    [True]
    
    6- Because failures can be very expensive
    [True]
    
    7- To avoid being sued by customers
    [True]
    
    8- To stay in business
    [False]


2- compare between :
    1- functional and non-functional testing

        -> Functional Testing:
            - Involves verifying that the system functions as expected.
            - Example:- Testing user login functionality.
        
        -> Non-functional Testing:
            - Focuses on non-functional aspects like performance, usability, and security.
            - Example:- Testing system response time.


    2- black box, white box, and gray box
        -> Black Box Testing:
            - Testing the system without knowing its internal structure.
            - Example: User interface testing.
        
        -> White Box Testing:
            - Involves testing the internal structure and code.
            - Example:- Unit testing.
        
        -> Gray Box Testing:
            - A mix of black box and white box testing, where the tester has some knowledge of the internal structure.
            - Example: Security testing with some knowledge of internal architecture.

    3- What is the SDLC?
        -> SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
            - A process that includes the steps of developing software from planning to maintenance.
            - Includes phases: Analysis, Design, Development(Implementation), Testing, and Evolution.


    4- What are the Testing levels?
        -> Unit Testing:
            - Testing individual components of the system.
        
        -> Integration Testing:
            - Testing integrated modules of the system.
        
        -> System Testing:
            - Testing the entire system as a whole.
        
        -> Acceptance Testing:
            - Testing by the end-user to ensure the system meets the requirements.
    

    5- What are the Testing Types?
        -> Manual Testing
        -> Automation Testing


    6- [Bouns] search for the difference between TDD and DDD and BDD :- 
        -> TDD (Test-Driven Development):- 
            - A software development approach where tests are written before code.
        
        -> DDD (Domain-Driven Design):- 
            - A software design approach focusing on the project's specific domain.
        
        -> BDD (Behavior-Driven Development):-
            - A software development approach focusing on the expected behavior of the system as defined by the user.

    7- Who does Testing?
        -> Developers:
            - Typically perform unit testing.
        
        -> Project Lead/Manager
            - Responsible for monitoring project development

        -> Testers:
            - Focus on functional and non-functional testing of the system.

        -> Users:
            - Perform acceptance testing to ensure the system meets their requirements.
